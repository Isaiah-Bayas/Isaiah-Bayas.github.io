These labs were great to work through and I cannot wait to see how many of the techniques that I learned in each of them will be used for future projects. It was a mix of easy, fair, and "why is this not working?" Amusingly, some of the moments where I was stuck simply came from a simple electronic mistake, such as, having a ground wire in the wrong column (voltage). Nevertheless, I think it's pretty fair to say that the Arduino Nano 33 IoT microcontroller has a smooth interface that is easily navigable and the IDE is fairly easy to use (I'm biased since it uses C++). Let's take a look at what I was able to do:
