## Asset Collection & Storyboarding Process

When beginning the process of creating my personal Cornell box, many ideas came to the forefront of my mind. In terms of storytelling, the ideal storyline that I envisioned was one that the told the story of my experiences growing up in New York City as a youth. Although this was my initial idea, my approach seemed to be a little bit tricky at first glance. In order to narrow down on my idea, I was able to reconfigure my approach by startignt with asset collection. First, I started with choosing the texture of what I wanted the environment to look like. Then, I began collecting assets that had significant value to the story that I wanted to convey about my personal interests. After settling on a texture of an art studio and 3D atifacts of old mediums for music, my idea came together. Music has been a consistent theme of mine and I wanted to create a gallery style interaction of music.
