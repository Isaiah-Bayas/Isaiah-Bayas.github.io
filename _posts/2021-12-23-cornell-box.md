## Asset Collection & Storyboarding Process

When beginning the process of creating my personal Cornell box, many ideas came to the forefront of my mind. In terms of storytelling, the ideal storyline that I envisioned was one that the told the story of my experiences growing up in New York City as a youth. Although this was my initial idea, my approach seemed to be a little bit tricky at first glance. In order to narrow down on my idea, I was able to reconfigure my approach by startignt with asset collection. First, I started with choosing the texture of what I wanted the environment to look like. Then, I began collecting assets that had significant value to the story that I wanted to convey about my personal interests. After settling on a texture of an art studio and 3D atifacts of old mediums for music, my idea came together. Music has been a consistent theme of mine and I wanted to create a gallery style interaction of music.

## Reflection & How to Iterate

There were many aspects of my Cornell box that I was not able to integrate, particularly with the interactions between the player and the assets I used. The goal is to continue to iterate by thinking through what type of interactions will be useful and fun for anybody who engages with my Cornell box.
